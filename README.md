# Advent of Code 2018
My solutions for the [2018 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/). They're all written in Rust!

## Running
Syntax:

```
advent-2018 <puzzle> <path_to_input>
```

`puzzle` is a number starting at 0 corresponding to the puzzle, in order of appearance - day 1's first puzzle is 0, day 1's second puzzle is 1, etc. `path_to_input` should be a path to a text file of input for the puzzle.
